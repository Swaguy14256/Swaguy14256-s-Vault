    <h3>October 22, 2024 - Changes to the site URL</h3>
    <p>Well, once again, it has been a long time since I posted something. This time, this post regards the site URL.</p>
    <p>Back on January 13, 2024, I had changed the URL of this site to the current and permanent one that is being used. The thing is, while doing so, I had somehow broken the MX records for the site, which while that may not sound too major, the problem is that when I registered the domain for this site, I had also created another email specifically for this site, and so, without the proper MX records, that email was flat out broken. Not only that, but it costs money to maintain the email, so I am not going to waste a year paying for the email just for it to be broken.</p>
    <p>Whatever the case is, I fixed it. However, this required me to slightly change the site URL because the CNAME record name would confict with the MX records. The new URL now has a "www" subdomain in it. This will unfortunately result in the old URL breaking, as I have not set up the redirect yet. That will be for January 2025, since that month is when I registered the domain.</p>
    <p>Anyway, that is all I needed to say. See you then.</p>
    <h3>September 23, 2023 - Long, Temporary Shutdown Of The Site</h3>
    <p>Well, it has been a while since I posted something here. Over 1 year, in fact. However, there is a reason why I am making this post.</p>
    <p>Earlier this year, in January, I found a major privacy issue on this site. It was so major, I HAD to shut down the site until I resolved this privacy issue. As for what this privacy issue was, it was that on free ngrok plans, just tunneling to HTTP Port 80 generates a random link. The problem is that random link includes your IPv4 or IPv6 address. IP addresses have a geographic location assigned to them, and in many cases, this location is the actual location of who's IP address it is. Unfortunately, this site was affected by this fact, which is why I shut it down in the first place.</p>
    <p>I did resolve this at like the end of January by finally purchasing a permanent domain for this site. However, I still needed to obtain a better ngrok plan to connect the domain to the ngrok client, and... yeah. Buying a domain for your site and leaving it unused for almost 9 months sure does not seem like a very smart idea, huh. Well, whatever the case is, ngrok DID finally allow free users to have one free "permanent domain". Quotations, because you cannot choose the free domain name, which is why it is still not the actual domain name I chose for this site. Still, it resolves the privacy issue, so I will use it until I can upgrade my ngrok plan.</p>
    <p>That is all I need to say. Stay tuned for more updates. See you then.</p>
    <h3>September 13, 2022 - 2 New YouTube Channels And Future Plans</h3>
    <p>I have created 2 more YouTube channels in preparation for whenever I actually start making YouTube videos. The first one (A Dead Guy) is an extras channel for content that does not belong to my main channel or the second new channel. The second channel (A Frozen Guy) is for gameplay and ROM Hack related videos. Keep in mind that I am not going to do live streams on this channel. On another note, I will never do any collaborations with any YouTube channel on any of my channels, so do not ask me to collaborate with any YouTuber; I will just put your request in the trash bin. One thing noteworthy about my channels is how much effort I put into their names, which is none at all. It was all for a garbage joke involving my Holiday names on SMW Central.</p>
    <p>As for future plans for this site, the first thing I need to do is get a permanent domain for this site. Right now, the site uses ngrok's free plan, which does not allow for permanent domain names. As a result, everytime I have to reboot the site, the link is different. Right now, I have created a replit site that simply redirects to the site, which works for most pages, but not so much for pages like the File Bin, and eventually the Games and Art Gallery. Therefore, before I make any major changes to the site, I will have to get a permanent domain so that way, I no longer have to change the link in the redirect function on the replit site.</p>
    <p>Once I get a permanent domain, the next things I plan on doing include getting a proper IDE for developing the site, improving and fixing the structure and codebase for the site, and improving the design of the website. Right now, the entire site is completly developed using only a plain text editor, which is Notepad. While this is a method that can be used, it is unintuitave because I cannot correct syntax errors or typos. In addition, I have to remember all of the HTML elements, CSS tags, and JavaScript commands when changing a page. With a proper IDE, I can maintain development of this site more easily, and I can make sure there are no syntax errors or typos. In addition, I can then fix the structure and codebase of the site. Right now, the structure and codebase of the site is garbage. A lot of elements are hardcoded, which includes the News updates being confined to a single page, the Art Gallery, Games, and Files Bin not actually checking for the lack of items or not, and said pages' last update date being completely manual instead of automated. In addition, there are missing features of the site due to the limited use of JavaScript, including the ability to sort Games and Files by Name, Date Added, and Size. As a result, I plan on making the Version History page include separation of versions based on development build and version number, separating each update on the News page into their own page with previews on the main page of the News section, separating the Copyright And Disclaimers Page articles in the same way as the News page, implementing JavaScript into the Art Gallery, Games, and Files Bin to allow for automatic sorting and optimization, along with proper file checking and update dates. I will have to use metadata for sorting, though that is not complicated. Finally, the current design of the site has lots of room for improvement. I will redesign the site to look less basic and more appealing, but not in a way that makes it focused on mobile users and not desktop or laptop users. Also, I am aware that the site has no icon. That will be fixed when I redesign the site. With all of that out of the way, once I get to these plans, I should be able to exit the Pre-Alpha stage and get the site into the Alpha stage of development.</p>
    <h3>May 13, 2022 - Temporary Shutdown Of This Site</h3>
    <p>If you were wondering what happened to this site for the past 6 months, it was shut down because of a dangerous exploit involving Log4j. Yes, it was confirmed a long time ago after the discovery of the exploit that Apache24 sites were unaffected, and I could have brought the site back sooner, but I was too lazy to a) figure this out, and b) bring back the site after discovering this fact. Either way, the site is now back up.</p>
    <h3>October 14, 2021 - Coming Soon: The Art Gallery</h3>
    <p>I have been inspired by many Japanese anime images, (mainly anime girl drawings) so I have decided to set up an art gallery where I will release my own drawings in this style. Currently, I have not established when the 1st drawing will be released, but it will come soon...</p>
    <h3>May 3, 2020 - Pre-Alpha Release</h3>
    <p>The Pre-Alpha build of my site has been released. I wanted to make this site since 2017, but I could not get the site to work. 2 1/2 years later, I finally got the server to work. Now I can start uploading stuff to this site.</p>
