    <h3>File Usage</h3>
    <p>Any file you download from this site can be used as long as you do not claim these files as your own. Do not redistribute any of my files without express permission.</p>
    <h3>Site Hosting Permissions</h3>
    <p>Right now, the only people allowed to use this site for hosting purposes are WMS95, the Geomtery Dash Shopkeeper, and myself. Otherwise, using my site to host any foreign content is prohibited on any grounds. Do not ask me to give you permission; I will immediately ignore you if you attempt to do so. The problem is that if I allow more people to use this site for hosting purposes, this site will become a file hosting site, which is not what I want this website to be. Because of this, I have to put these restrictions in place so it is clear that I am not going to let you use this site to host your content.</p>
    <h3>Art I (Plan To) Post</h3>
    <p>In the near future, I will be posting artwork to this website. When it comes to these images, saving them for personal use is allowed. You are also allowed to post the URLs associated with these images. However, do not repost any art I draw without my express permission. In the case I give you permission to repost one of my artworks, you acknowledge that I have the ability to, at any given point in time, to change my mind and prohibit you from reposting any further pieces of artwork. There are various situations that can lead to this, including, but not limited to:</p>
    <p>- Using my art to decieve others.</p>
    <p>- Using my art for any illegal actvities.</p>
    <p>- Using my art for predatory reasons.</p>
    <p>- Using my art to attack my brand or likliness.</p>
    <p>Although you are allowed to use the characters portrayed in my art for internet avatars, I do not encourage it.</p>
    <h3>Lolicon & Shotacon Art</h3>
    <p>In the off chance that I decide to draw art that is Not Safe For Work (which can only be viewed by adults), I may decide to draw lolicon and shotacon related art. Lolicon and shotcon art is not considered to be a form of child sexual exploitation material, and any claims of such are false. Some countries confusingly lump lolicon and shotcon art with actual real-life child sexual exploitation material under the guise of protecting children. This does the opposite effect, as it make it harder for law enforcement to track down child sexual exploitation material, and deal with the individuals responsible for thie child abuse. Therefore, if I do draw lolicon and shotacon art, any claims of me being a sexual predator, a pedophile, and an individual producing child pornography are false. Attempting to label me as those claims will result in severely negative consequences. Furthermore, atempting to use any lolicon and/or shotacon art I draw for illegal and predatory reasons will result in negative consequences far more severe than using art not within this category for the same reasons. With the taboo nature of this kind of art, I cannot be kind to those who use these drawings for malicous purposes; it is dangerous to not only myself, but children in general.</p>
    <h3>Games</h3>
    <p>Games you download from this site cannot be redistributed on other sites without my permisson. Like any drawings I make, I can change my mind and prohibit you from redistributing any more games if I give you permission to do so in the first place.</p>
