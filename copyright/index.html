    <h3>File Usage</h3>
    <p>Any file you download from this site can be used as long as you do not claim these files as your own. Do not redistribute any of my files without express permission; there is no reason to, and these files are whatever I feel like uploading onto this site, so it is unconfirmed if these files are truly safe or not.</p>
    <h3>Site Hosting Permissions</h3>
    <p>Previously, I allowed WMS95 and the Geomtery Dash Shopkeeper use this site to host foreign content. The thing is, WMS95 was a roleplay account I operated, and the Geomtery Dash Shopkeeper was a roleplay account Minif operated. As a result, I never actually allowed anyone other than Minif to use this site for hosting purposes. This was during the time when Minif's and my operation of both channels was kept a secret. Since we have now revealed ourselves as the operators of those 2 channels, this is no longer the case. As for Minif himself, he will no longer use my site for any future hosting purposes since he has his own site for hosting stuff.</p>
    <p>Effective, January 19th, 2023, using my site for hosting purposes is prohibited on any grounds. Do not ask me to give you permission; attempts to get my permission are completely ignored. This is NOT a file hosting site; that is not what I built this website for. As such, no one except myself can host stuff on this website.</p>
    <h3>Art I (Plan To) Post</h3>
    <p>In the near future, I will be posting artwork to this website. When it comes to these images, saving them for personal use is allowed. Posting the URLs associated with these images. Reposting any art I draw is allowed under the condition that it is not your own work. As for modifications, they are allowed, but they MUST be explicitly mentioned when reposting. When reposting one of my artworks, you realize that I have the ability to, at any given point in time, to prohibit you from reposting any further pieces of artwork. There are various situations that can lead to this, including, but not limited to:</p>
    <p>- Using my art to decieve others.</p>
    <p>- Using my art for any illegal actvities.</p>
    <p>- Using my art for predatory reasons.</p>
    <p>- Using my art to attack my brand or likliness.</p>
    <p>Using the characters portrayed in my art for internet avatars is acceptable. No credit is needed in that case.</p>
    <h3>Lolicon & Shotacon Art</h3>
    <p>In the off chance that I decide to draw art that is Not Safe For Work (which can only be viewed by adults), I may decide to draw lolicon and shotacon related art. Lolicon and shotcon art is not considered to be a form of child sexual exploitation material, and any claims of such are false. Some countries confusingly lump lolicon and shotcon art with actual real-life child sexual exploitation material under the guise of protecting children. This does the opposite effect, as it make it harder for law enforcement to track down child sexual exploitation material, and deal with the individuals responsible for thie child abuse. Therefore, if I do draw lolicon and shotacon art, any claims of me being a sexual predator, a pedophile, and an individual producing child pornography are false. Attempting to label me as those claims will result in severely negative consequences. Furthermore, atempting to use any lolicon and/or shotacon art I draw for illegal and predatory reasons will result in negative consequences far more severe than using art not within this category for the same reasons. With the taboo nature of this kind of art, I cannot be kind to those who use these drawings for malicous purposes; it is dangerous to not only myself, but children in general.</p>
    <h3>Games</h3>
    <p>Games you download from this site can be redistributed on other sites as long as the contents in the downloads from this site are not modifed or removed. In addition, acknowledgement that the games are not your own work is required.</p>
