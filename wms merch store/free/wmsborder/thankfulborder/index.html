  <p>Here is a Thanksgiving themed border used in WMS95's videos. This version is used during Late November, and was first used in Options "Earrape" Earrape - Sonic (The Hedgehog) Spinball Music. (Except that didn't come out until 1 month later. In addition, it was also oversaturated and had very high gamma.)<!--Secret Toon Zelda Site Revealed ***A HIDDEN SITE WE MADE***.--></p>
