  <p>This is the music from Sonic (The Hedgehog) Spinball but it was recorded from a real Sega Genesis, made to loop forever. Credit goes to DUSTINODELLOFFICIAL for providing the recording. You can download this FLAC if you want to listen to it anywhere. Included in the download is a TXTP file so the track can loop. (vgmstream is required.)</p>
