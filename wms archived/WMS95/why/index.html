  <p>When I was uploading How To Record Lossless Videos In OBS Studio **IMPROVE YOUR VIDEOS**, the video took a really long time to upload because it was a losslessly compressed .avi being uploaded that was 17.6 GB in size. To make sure YouTube would actually upload .avi files like the one mentioned, I clipped a segment of gameplay used in because i can and uploaded this to the site as a test. I kept it private for far too long, but now it is unlisted and you can watch this for any random reason now.</p>
