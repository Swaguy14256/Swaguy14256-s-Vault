  <p>A video where I rant on WalterGuy. This was removed because WalterGuy was just giving me criticism, not actual hate. I almost permanently deleted the video off of my hard drive, but I retrieved the file from the recycling bin. After I removed the video from YouTube, I took the project file and turned it into Tips For WalterGuy. The tips video replaced this video as my 6th video. Here is the full video, this time without the filler intro in the YouTube version.</p>
