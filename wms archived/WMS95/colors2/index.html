  <p>This is an old unreleased version of my COLORS 2 playthrough. It was meant to introduce Mario as a character, and in addition, I would have revealed the Secret Toon Zelda Site during the video. I was not satisfied with the result of this video, so I split it into 3 videos: Mario's introduction was put into the 10 Subscribers Special, the Secret Toon Zelda Site reveal was made into its own video, and the actual playthrough was left as its own video.</p>
