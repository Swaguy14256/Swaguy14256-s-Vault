  <p>One day, Spiderguy28 managed to trick the Shopkeeper into giving away owner privelages by using an alt. He, along with Mosquitoguy5672, vandalized the site and banned all common users. This video adressed this issue. It was taken down because the situation was resolved.
  
  Edit: This video was re-uploaded on the channel. As such, this archive is now delisted.
