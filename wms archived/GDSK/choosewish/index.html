  <p>Deciding Bob THE LEVEL's Wish Video. Bob THE LEVEL suggested me to make a Bowser's Inside Story but crashed in Geometry Dash piece. However, he did not state a specific piece. Therefore, I spun a wheel and it picked it for me. Basically, I put 10 of my favorite pieces and spun. Of course, the one it picks needs 3ds footage. I was going to include this footage but I decided against it.</p>
