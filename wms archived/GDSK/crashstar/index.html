  <p>All Star, but it is crashed in Geometry Dash. It was meant to correct many of the mistakes of the first video, such as the crashes, pitch, and so on. However, this video was taken down due to a copyright claim that blocked it from viewing over the world. A re-upload taking out the All Star trailer was released.</p>
