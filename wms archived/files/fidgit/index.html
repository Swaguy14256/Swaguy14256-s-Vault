  <p>DESIGNiT, BUILDiT, FIDGiT. Solve challenges to save tiny creatures called Fidgits! Check out the library of challenges or make your own to share with friends. This was a flash game on PBS Kids GO, until they decided to remove it. We were unable to recover the entire program, so parts are contained in this zip.</p>
