  <h2>About Page</h2>
  <div>
    <h3>Swaguy14256</h3>
    <p>I am a person that likes to play games, make videos, program and ROM hack video games, and do other stuff.</p>
    <h3>Contact</h3>
    <p>If you really need to contact me, use this <a href=mailto:sm64swaguy14256@gmail.com>email</a>. For issues related to this site, use this <a href=mailto:sm64swaguy14256@swaguy14256svault.com>email</a> instead.</p>
    <h3>Other Profiles</h3>
    <p>I have 3 YouTube Channels (<a href = https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcz5xQBpImnOvPuTf0fu_bQ>Channel 1</a>, <a href = https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9MvacfaXyF5j2cOwYe9FGQ>Channel 2</a>, <a href = https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzWRtGhq5cjZg4q2M0pUolg>Channel 3</a>), an <a href = https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=profile&id=41973>SMW Central profile</a>, a <a href = https://steamcommunity.com/id/swaguy14256>Steam profile</a>, and also a <a href = https://github.com/Swaguy14256>GitHub account</a>. These are the only sites I use, so any other account that has my name is fake.</p>
    <p>Also now worth mentioning, the YouTube Channels <a href = https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiFt008F7LUdgE5Se0kN3Fg>WMS95</a> and <a href = https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0PczZElMMhWebqRVQ10XAw>mosquitoguy5672</a> are also mine, and have been mine from the start. Thing is, prior to January 19, 2023, I treated those accounts as if I did not operate both of them. Please see <a href = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4C3RSltTKg>this video</a> to know the full story behind WMS95 and mosquitoguy5672. Keep in mind any accounts linked to those two channels are also mine... except for <a href = https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=profile&id=41963>WMS95's SMW Central profile</a>; that site has a no alternate account policy, and thus, I cannot operate that account since I have my own account on that site. To compensate, Minif runs WMS95's SMW Central account instead.
